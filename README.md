# The impact of the early-game in League of Legends


## Description  
This data science project, conducted at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), explores the impact of the **"early-game"** in *League of Legends* matches. The study follows a comprehensive analytical process, including:  

- Exploratory data analysis  
- Hypothesis testing  
- Baseline model creation  
- Fairness analysis  

The primary objective is to evaluate the influence of the early-game on match statistics and outcomes.

## Introduction  
*League of Legends* (*LoL*) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Riot Games. With millions of players worldwide, it has become a cornerstone of esports and one of the most influential games in the industry.  

This project relies on a professional dataset provided by **Oracleâ€™s Elixir**, which includes statistics from competitive *LoL* matches throughout the year 2024. 

 In League of legends, the early game corresponds to the first few minutes of the game. It's a very important period that will define the middle and end of the game, and consequently its overall trajectory. These first few minutes will influence all the strategies implemented by the teams and the final outcome.

So we're going to ask ourselves **how much the early game affects the overall trend of a game, and how much it affects the final result.** The study of the data set will enable us to answer these questions, while allowing us to understand the impact of different parameters over the course of a game.
